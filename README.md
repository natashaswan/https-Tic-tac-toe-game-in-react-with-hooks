## Tic-tac-Toe Game in React with hooks
I updated the code of this [project](https://github.com/natashaswan/Tic-Tac-Toe-game-made-in-React) using React useState hook. 

## Known issues 
Currently there is no algorithm that determines  draw. The game shows X is the winner in case of a draw. It's easy to fix and I will fix it once I have a spare minute. 

## How to start
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run npm install 
3. Run npm start
